Whats Here To GPRMC
===================

A simple no frills tool to generate [GPRMC Sentences](http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea/#rmc) using Google Maps.

I wrote this to automate the tedious manual process of generating "pseudo" GPRMC sentences which is as follows.
- Determine coordinates using Google Maps whats here function
- Convert the coordinates to degrees minutes format used in GPRMC sentence using one of the many online tools available
- Manually create the Gps Sentence by hand using the coordintes

If your wondering  why would you want to generate GPRMC sentences -
I needed to generate "Gold Data" i.e to find the correct coordinates (according to Google Maps) 
for compartive testing and studies in order to determine the accuracy of a Gps based embedded device visually and computationally
using tools which accepted only GPRMC sentences. 

The only fields in the sentence that are soft-coded are the Latitude, Longitude, Date and Time.
The code will be need to be updated to add the correct checksum etc if that is required.
